     *  The output scene must meet the following requirements:<br>
     * <ul>
     * <li>At least a root node must be there, even if its only purpose is to reference one mesh.</li>
     * <li>aiMesh::mPrimitiveTypes may be 0. The types of primitives in the mesh are determined automatically in this
     *   case.</li>
     * <li>the vertex data is stored in a pseudo-indexed "verbose" format. In fact this means that every vertex that is
     *   referenced by a face is unique. Or the other way round: a vertex index may not occur twice in a single
     *   aiMesh.</li>
     * <li>aiAnimation::mDuration may be -1. Assimp determines the length of the animation automatically in this case as
     *   the length of the longest animation channel.</li>
     * <li>aiMesh::mBitangents may be NULL if tangents and normals are given. In this case bitangents are computed as the cross product
     *   between normal and tangent.</li>
     * <li>There needn't be a material. If none is there a default material is generated. However, it is recommended
     *   practice for loaders to generate a default material for yourself that matches the default material setting for
     *   the file format better than Assimp's generic default material. Note that default materials *should* be named
     *   AI_DEFAULT_MATERIAL_NAME if they're just color-shaded or AI_DEFAULT_TEXTURED_MATERIAL_NAME if they define a
     *   (dummy) texture. </li>
     * </ul>
     * If the AI_SCENE_FLAGS_INCOMPLETE-Flag is <b>not</b> set:<ul>
     * <li> at least one mesh must be there</li>
     * <li> there may be no meshes with 0 vertices or faces</li>
     * </ul>
     * This won't be checked (except by the validation step): Assimp will crash if one of the conditions is not met!
     *
     * @param pFile Path of the file to be imported.
